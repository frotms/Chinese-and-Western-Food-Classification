The CHINESEFOODNET dataset is a dataset contains labeled Chinese food images. This dataset was captured by douguo user and labeled by the our employees. It was collected for training deep learning models to recognize Chinese food dishes. This dataset is available free of charge for academic research only. Commercial licenses are available upon request. 

DATA FORMAT:

The dataset is provided with the total size of 19.4 GB. We have splited the whole dataset into training, testing and validation sets. There are 145,066 images for training, 20,254 images for validation and 20,310 images for testing. This folder contains 3 sub directories including:

train 	--- images for training
val 	--- images for validation
test 	--- images for testing

In the train and val folder, there are 208 directories numbered from 000 to 207. Each directory contains JPG images with its original size. Each directory contains only one type of food. 

In the test folder, only images are provided without ground truth labels.

Besides, there are 5 files in this folder:
class_names.csv		--- class names in both Chinese and English
train_list.txt, 	--- image names and labels of the training set
val_list.txt,	 	--- image names and labels of the validation set
test_list.txt,	 	--- image names of the test set
